## Changed
* Improved buzzsaw tree detection
  * Instead of just clearing a pillar, it now tries to detect branches
  * The max size of trees that can be successfully harvested is now way bigger
  * This means that things like 2x2 jungle trees can now be automated

## Fixed
* Fixed NBTStack serialization omitting the stack size most of the time, preventing deserialization (mainly in the precision assembler config)
* Fixed precision assembler not being listed in the creative inventory
* Fixed OpenComputers integration for the CCGT
* Fixed tool abilities switching when clicking on a block with a special interaction
